# Problem Statement for the Case Study Interview
## Identifying Doctor Success and Patient Adherence
##### The team at Dermo Inc released a new medication, DermSkin, in January 2024. Over the last 6 months, they’ve seen significant growth in the use of it across the US. The team is looking to identify what doctors are seeing the most success with prescribing DermSkin to their patients to target similar doctors going forward. To answer this question, they’ve shared the attached dataset with you. They’d like you to use this dataset to identify which doctors are having the most success with the brand. You should consider questions like:
### ● Which doctors specifically are writing the most prescriptions?
### ● What specialty of doctors are shipping the most orders?
### ● How often are doctors writing prescriptions, but their orders are not ultimately being shipped?

##### Further, the team is curious about the success of the brand for patients. There are numerous metrics to define success and they’re leaving it to you to decide what you’d define it as. However, they have given these ideas as potential metrics of success:
### ● High values of shipped orders out of the created orders
### ● The order is covered by insurance
### ● Patient adherence (Looking at a specific period of time, how much of that time did the patient have medication on hand) They’re open to any other ideas you have about measuring success too, so feel free to be creative.

### The ultimate goal from the data insights you provide is for them to understand the audiences that have seen the most success with their product. They will use this information to target doctors and patients to get these individuals access to this medication.
